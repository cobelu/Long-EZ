### CHAPTER 1. GENERAL #### TABLE OF CONTENTS. Long-Ez documentation is available in 
the sections shown below. Section I consists of this book, plus an appendix of 14 18" x 24" drawings. The contents of all sections are shown in the following: I MANUFACTURING MANUAL for basic air­
frame -includes education on composite materials and construction, plans and 
construction manual for entire aircraft except engine installation.

IIA Engine Installation -Plans for 0-200 
Continental aircraft engine. Includes 
drawings and installation instructions 
for the engine, baffling, engine controls, exhaust, carb heat muff and box, engine instru􀀣ents prop, spinner, cowling 
and induction.

IIC Same as IIA, except for the Lycoming 
0-235 engine.

Owners Manual -Flight and maintenance 
manual. Includes normal and emergency 
procedures, weight and balance,check 
lists, detailed flying qualities 
descriptions, operating limitations, 
performance charts, maiden flight test 
procedures, pilot checkout procedures, 
and record keeping requirements. VI Landing Brake -Drawings for landing 
drag device to increase glide angle 
and reduce float in the flare.

NOTE -Section I, II, VI and a subcription to "The Canard Pusher" newsletter starting with No. 24 (April 80) are required to build a Long­EZ. The Owners Manual is required before flying your Long-EZ . WARNING -These plans are obsolete unless updated by newsletters 24 and on. Do not fail to do this, as it is possible that MANDATORY flight­ safety improvements may occur.

DESCRIPTION/INTRODUCTION. Description 
The Long-EZ is a high performance, homebuilt aircraft. Its compact external size results in superb 
performance and economy using low horsepower 
engines. Inside, it provides comfort for 
two, both up to 61611 tall and 240 lbs, pl us two meduim-size custom suitcases and 
6 cubic feet of strake baggage area -all 
accessable from the cockpits. Its canard 
configuration was designed not only for 
performance, but to provide improved flying qualitites and safety as compared to the 
conventional light plane (see owners manual, for complete details on flying qual itites 
and performance). The Long-EZ uses the
latest aerodynamic features. It uses the 
NASA -developed winglet system, and modern airfoils. Its high-lift canard wing has full-span flaps which double as elevator and landing mounted inboard for control sytem s1mpl1c1ty􀀃 􀀄
and low adverse yaw. The aircraft has 
a drag devise, called a Landing Brake, 
to dirty it up, allowing use of r􀀆nways 
as short as 1800 ft, with appropriate pilot skill. The glide angle at idle power without the landing brake deployed is only 3.7 
degrees. Thus, the brake is required to provide the normal descent control of conventional (less efficient) aircraft. Yaw control and main-wheel brake systems 
are combined, to further result in major simplification and improved flying qualities. The pilot has simple, one-piece rudder 
pedals to control rudder and wheel-brake to its functions. rudder A with cable a is spring run from returning each pedalthe rudder to a sealed neutral position. The outward camber of the winglet's rudder 
is such that the rudder brakeout force is increased with airspeed. This allows pleasantly low rudder forces at low speed where rudder 
is needed and higher initial forces at 
high speed where there is no requirement 
for rudder control. The rudder pedals are narrow enough to allow the pilot to tilt so his feet and move them in front of thepedals he can stretch out and relax his feet forward during cruise. The rudder cable moves a b􀀒lcrank at the firewall such that after full rudder is reached, further motion of the rudder pedal actuates its respective wheel-brake master cylinder. This system 
is less complex than the coupled rudder 
and toebrake system found in conventional aircraft. Also, it results in less brake wear since it is impossible to apply brake in a given direction without already using full rudder power. An adjustable bungee system provides pitch trim, adjusted by a lever on the left console. Roll trim is via bungee adjustment to the aileron controls. The main landing gear is a one-piece, molded, unidirectional fiberglass strut extending from design one axle eleiminates to the the other. excessive The leverage one-piece loads found in conventional two-piece gear 
legs. This allows a much lighter structural 
attachment at the fuselage. The gear and 
attactrnent ·have successfully undergone 
drop test to FAR-23 criteria. The gear 
strut is molded in an airfoil shape. The 
strut is designed to enter at the top of 
the 
to reduce wheel pant, interference rather than drag. at The the cruise side, 
penalty due to the main gear being fixed, 
is only 6 knots. Thus, the increase in 
empty weight, increased cost, and increased maintenance of a retractable main gear 
is not justified. The nose landing gear is a fiberglass strut, 
molded to the outside contour of the fuselage. 
The strut fits into a groove in the fuselage, 
thus a strut door is not required. The 
gear is retracted/extended by simple worm­
drive mechanism. The gear is retracted 
on the ground after the pilot gets out 
to allow the aircraft to park with its 
nose down, resting on a rubber bumper. 
Kneeled parking is used for several reasons: 
The aircraft is not as susceptible to upset its from nose, high the surface propeller winds is when raised parked to ona convenient height for hand starting, and 
the nose bumper provides a chock so that 
chocking the wheels is not required for 
hand starting. Refer to the owners manual 
for inflight and ground operation of the 
nose gear and for details on tiedown 
procedure. The fuel system glass/foam/glass-composite cons-us of two, fuel tanks, 26-gallowhi􀀚 ch form wing strakes along the sides. The

### CHAPTER 4 

#### FUSELAGE BULKHEADS

Overview - In this chapter you will manufacture the six bulkheads that go into your Long-EZ fuselage. Two of the bulkheads are your front and rear seat backs, another doubles as your instrument panel, and still another is the firewall. 0.'2..-in􀀓 thick, high density 􀀁A PV·corte: is used in the instrument panel and other 
forward bulkheads. Type R-45 PV core (dark blue) is 
used in the seat back bulkheads. Birch plywood is 
used in the firewall bulkhead. You will find that 
there are many short jobs in this chapter with cure 
cycles in between, so you may.want to work on several 
of the bulkheads simultaneously or even do some work 
in following chapters while waiting for a cure. Appro­
ximately 20 man-hours are required for bulkheads. 

##### STEP 1 - Front seat bulkhead 
Refer to chapter 5 to see how the inclined front seat 
bulkhead fits in the fuselage. Cut a rectangular piece of .8" thick R-45 foam 28.3 long and 23 inches wide. 
Taper and round one end as shown. Cut 2 plies UNO 
and glass the front side and tapered end. Knife trim 
flush with the foam edges all around. After cure, flip over, taper and round the other end 
( ,'1" al so) and round the side edges. The one ply BID 
glass skin on the back not only covers the back and 
taper but also folds around the side edges to meet 
the glass on front. Support the bulkhead up about 
1" above the table so the glass edges can hang down 
unobstructed by the table surface. Use a ¼" flox corner all around. After cure, use a finetooth coping saw 
and notch the corners as shown to fit the fuselage 
longerons.
