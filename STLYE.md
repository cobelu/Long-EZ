# Style Guide

## Format

### Sentences

Each sentence should be on it's own line.

#### Example:

```
This is a sentence.
This is another sentence.
This is a third sentence.
```

### Independent Clauses

Long sentences should be split over multiple lines.
There should be a newline character after the comma.
The conjuction should start the next line.
Note that this is a flexible suggestion.

#### Example:

```
This is a clause,
and this is another clause,
but this is a third clause.
```

### Dependent Clauses

Long sentences with dependent clauses can also be split into multiple lines.
Note that this is a somewhat flexible suggestion since it is truly an opinion.

### Paragraphs

Paragraps should be split with a single, blank line in-between.

#### Example:

``` markdown
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
``` 

## Styling

There is  no consistent styling in the original plans.

### Underlines

There does not exist an underline command in Markdown.
Instead, use `_` to bold the characters.
This is due 

#### Example: 

``` markdown
This will be __underlined__.
```

### Headers

There is not a consistent use of headers within the original plans.
In general,

* Chapter numbers should be at the top of the respective chapter's file in H1.
* Chapter titles should follow the chapter number in H2.
* Step titles should be in H3.
* Overviews should not be in a heading. Instead, they should be formatted like so: `Overview - [Overview]`

## "Fixes"

There are many grammatical mistakes and typos in the original plans.
Whereas scans of the original plans are available within the repo,
typos and minor grammatical errors should be fixed.

### Capitalization

There is no consistent use of capitalization in the original plans.
Titles of headings should follow title case for aesthetic purposes.
Capitalization should follow MLA rules.
A handy converter is [located here](https://titlecaseconverter.com/). 

### Typos

Any typical spell checker can be used to flag typos.
Typos should be corrected.
Technical terms like "flox" and "microed" may not be recognized by a spell checker,
but they should be considered correct as they are.

### Grammatical Errors

Any minor grammatical errors should be fixed.
Major grammatical syntax updates *can* be done but only with caution.
When doing so, the goal should be to improve the readibility of the sentece.
The phrases meaning should never be changed,
and no information should be lost.

There are also many run-on sentences.
These can be broken down into smaller sentences in order to improve readability.

Remember: the project goal is to preserve and improve.
The project goal is *not* to create substantial changes.
