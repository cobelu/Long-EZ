CHAPTER 12 

CANARD INSTALLATION 

OVERVIEW, In this chapter you will align􀀃the and futemporarily install the canard on zeroselage. The canard is aligned  for  sweep, zero dihedral, and zero in-cidence. Alignment pins are installed in the F28 bulkhead and alignment tabs installed on the canard to match. The  canard tabs (aluminum tabs installed
on the canard in chapter ) are drilled in place and nut plates are installed to 

STEP 1 

INSTALLING THE ALIGNMENT PINS 

This should only take 1/2 hour. Cut the head3off of two AN-J-20 or -20A bolts 
and sand or file a round nose on the un­threaded ends. Drill two holes in the F28 bulkhead and wood doublers as shown about 1-1/2-inch deep. Check that the pins will slip into the holes and stick out only about 1/2". Do not bond the pins in yet.

STEP 2 

ALIGNING THE CANARD 

This step may crowd your shop slightly, 
but only takes about an hou􀀹 and you need 
an assistant occasionally to help measure things. 
Get your canard out of storage and position it ( wi thouteloiiltoM) on the fuse­lage as shown on pag£: A-7 . Use a pair 
of "C" clamps to hold the Llf:T tabs against the bulkhead (be careful not to 
bend or scratch them). Check for zero sweep­back by measuring from the canard tips to the wing fittings as shown. Both should measure the same. Use shims between the canard lift tabs and the forward bulkhead 
to adjust the sweep if necessary. 
Next􀁆level across the ·top fuselage lorl@:erons and the canard spar.cap. Last­ly (and most important), use your canard incidence blocksto accurately set the inci­dence at zero with the top longerons, 
The patternsfor the incidence block is found on page A- J3 If your canard has a 
slight twist, set the average incidence equal to the longerons, Recheck sweep, dihedral, and incidence and clamp firmly 
in position, Use the #10 􀁛ilot holes in 
the canard tabs and drill #10 through the H.Z bulkhead. Go cut two tabs of high density foam (dark red) as shown. 
Trim the tabs so that they fit 􀀲ainst the top of the canard and against a 1/lt)" shim on the bulkhead with the pin in the hole as shown. With everything trimmed 
to fit, .5MIN the tabs to the canard, 
When hard, carefully remove the canard without knocking the tabs loose,
