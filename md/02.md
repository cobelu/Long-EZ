# Chapter 2

## BILL OF MATERIALS

This chapter is a listing of the materials and components which are required to build a Long-EZ. The parts are catagorized by type for your convenience when ordering. The parts are also categorized by plans chapter to assist you in locating them during construction.

RAF maintains a close liaison with the distributors listed to assure proper materials specification and quality control. The distributors listed here are the only approved sources for materials. Do not make substitutions for the structural materials shown. The indicated materials were selected, developed, tested, and optimized for ease of construction and structural integrity. RAF cannot provide assistance in the application of substitute materials. Each authorized distributor has a catalog or descripÂ­tive price list of the materials and components that they provide. The catalogs often cover a range of items beyond the basic requirements shown in this B.O.M. and serve as a very handy reference. Those distributors who charge for their catalogs will refund the catalog charge with your first order.
