CHAPTER 9
HAIN LANDING GEAR AND LANDING BRAKE 

OVERVIEW: In this chapter you will mate the main landing 
gear to the fuselage and to the wheels/brakes/axles. You will sand the entire gear dull, and layup B plies of UNO at 4e0 over the strut for tortional stiffness. You will trim the molded gear legs to fityour axle/brake assembly, Jig the !l@ar strut into position on the fuselage, make the attacll!lent glass tab layups and assemble the gear onto the fuselage. With the gear installed, the 11les are mounted, drilled in, and installed. Brake lines are installed and routed through the baggage compartment and firewall. The main gear strut is a one piece, airfoil shaped •s• glass molded part, available through.• VariEze distributor. Caution: Do not. use a VariEze gear (161b). A Long-EZ gear weighs 2a1b. The gear and its structure have been sucessful ly drop tested to the stringent requirements of FAR part 23 for certified aircraft. The Cleveland 500 x 5 wheel and brake assembly and axles are available from VariEze distributors. The 4130N suel tubes and machined steel plugs are also available through a VariEze distributor. 

TORTIONAL STIFFNESS LAYUP.

This step should take 3 hours. Using brand new 36 or 40 grit sand paper, thoroughly sand the gear strut until the entjre surface is dull. Drive 3 nails into the top of your work bench so that the gear strut can sit on the heads of the nails. Rough the heads of the nails with a coarse file, and glue the gear strut, trail­edge up, to the nail heads with a dab of five minute epoxy mixed with a 1 ittle flox. This will hold the gear in position in order to make the layup. After the five minute epoxy is thoroughly cured, you wil ° 1 make a layup using UNO strips, cut 9" wide and 30 to the selvidge edge. You will need 16 strips, (see sketch). 

Now paint a coat of pure epoxy (Safe-T-Poxy or RAEF) all over the strut and layup the first ply of UNO so that the major fibers ° cross the face of the strut at approximately 30 to 40 on each face. It should take 2 "strips" of UNO to layup one ply from tip to tip. Do not lap the UNO, but rather butt them together at the center. Up to ¼" gap between each piece is acceptable and far better than an over lap joint. The second ply is layed up with the major fibers cra ing the first ply of UNO ppposite angle). Thus, you wi n have a cross hatched effect (see sketch). Similarly the third and forth pl.ies of UNO are layed up, giving you a tortionally very stiff 4 ply layup. In all cases the major fibers must be straight without wrinkles. Allow this layup to cure completely. A sharp blow will crack the gear strut free from the nail heads. Now you must trim the excess glass. Use a hard block and 36 grit, sand the edges of the layup to a good transition to the molded "s" glass. Now the strut is mounted on the 3 nail heads again, this tiroe leadin edge up, and 4 plys of UNO, crossing each o Uier, are layed up, exactly as you did the first 4 plies. After this layup cures, remove the strut from the nail heads, trim the excess glass, and sand it smooth. Do not cut into the previous layup. 

Now you must trim the leading edges at the axles to clear the brake calipers, {see sketch) and accomodate the wheel/brake/axle assembly. 

LANDING BRAKE 

Kefer to Section VI (Landing brake) install this system now. Note that the rudder conduit will later fit outside LB 17 rather than as shown in Section VI. Refer to Chapter 24 for the required left arm rest installation. Due to different armrest dimentions,substitute an AN-26A bolt for the AN4-22A bolt and use two LB16 spacers. 

Also, the Long-EZ brake is slightly larger.--------:- Increase the 16xl6 d􀀣n􀀤ion to 17.5xl7.5. 

POSITIONING THE MAIN GEAR ON THE FUSELAGE. 

This step will take about 2 hours and an assistant is desirable. Cut four ¼" thick jigging blocks {shown full size figure 1) from ¼" ply wood. Bevel the blocks as shown (figure 2) 0.8" to a sharp edge. Drill 5/8" diameter hole.through all 4 pieces to fit nicely on the steel tube. Slip 2 jigging blocks on each tube, bevels to the outside, and bolt the tubes into place between the aluminum angles on the fuselage. Turn your fuselage upside down on a pair of saw horses. Level the fuselage longitudinally and laterally (pitch and roll) using the ttp longerons as a reference (figure IA). Place the main gear leg in position onthe four jigging blocks, You may need small foam wedges to space the gear leg up off the steel tube, Make certain that the center line of the gear leg is in line with the fuselage center line. Double check by levelling accross the ends of the gear legs. Don't be concerned if the tabs do not set exactly flat on the gear leading and trailing edges. Just do the best you can to match them up as shown in figure 2, Use the aft face of the center section spar as a vertical reference at 8.L. 26, 75, and F .S. 125.5 (refer to chapter 8) for setting the fore and aft position of the gear leg. This is done by holding a straight edge vertical against the back face of the center section spar and moving the gear leg until the axle center line is i5" forward of the straight edge. {see sketch),111 

Do this on both sides, shimming the gear leg into position as required. At this point check that the plywood jigg1ng blocks are centered up on the steel tube. You should have 0.65 approximately of steel tube showing on each side of the plywood blocks.{see figure 2), Now trowel a generous blob of Bondo between the plywood and gear leg_ This must be capable of supporting the plywood blocks while you layup the outer glass tabs. (figure 3). Also, Bonda the steel tube to the plywood block, just a tiny dab will do (figure 2). After the Bonda has cured, carefully remove the AN6-80A through bolt and 1 ift the gear leg off the fuselage, Set it down on its axle ends and support it well. Now Bonda a small wood reference pointer (figure 2 & 3) to the gear leg under each steel tube. When this is cured, scribe a mark on each steel tube to coincide with the reference point {figure 2), this wil 1 enable you to replace the steel tubes in exactly the same position. Now carefully scrape the small Bonda dabs off the steel tubes, and withdraw the tubes from the plywood jigging 􀄁locks. Be sure not to displace the jigging blocks or the reference point, 

Now turn the gear leg upside down and support it well on two foam blocks, 3 feet apart-Thoroughly sand the main gear leg using 36 grit where the glass ta􀆒s wil 1 go, and sand {hard block) a good smooth trans1tion from the plywood jigging blocks to the glass gear leg. Now stick grey (duct or furnace) tape on the plywood jigging block for a good release. You are now ready to layup the glass tabs. 

GEAR ATTAClt4ENT FITTING LAYUP. 

This step should take about 2 hours. Cut 72 plies of 􀂏D 2½" x 12", cut 72 plies of BID 21" x 2½", and cut 72 plies of BID 21" x Ji" (see figure 4A). Using Safe-T-Poxy (or RAEF) wet out 18 plies of UNO 21" x 12" on a piece of paper (not wax paper) as shown in the hoto to make a thick UNO lass pad. Squeege out excess and check for dryness. Then paint a coat of epoxy over the gear leg and fore and aft plywood blocks. Now peel the wet 18 plies of 􀃘D off the paper and lay it across the gear and down the grey tape face of each jigging block, as shown in the photos. This should 

overlap the plywood pieces all around. Squeege out excess epoxy. Now, layup 18 plies of BID 2½" x 3½" on a piece of paper, peel the wet layup off the paper and place it on the aft face of the plywood block over the 18 plies of UNO, and lapped up over the trailing edge of the gear. (figure3). Now make a si'!'ilar 18 ply BID layup using 2½" x 3½" and place it on the face of the leading edge plywood block over the 18 plies of UNO and lapping up over the leading edge (figure 3). With the UNO wrap and BID pads in place, cover with Siran wrap. Using 2½" x 2½" square blocks of ¼" plywood, on either side of the jigging block, and a small 'c' clamp, to hold everything securely in place until cured. (see figure 48). The siran wrap keeps the plywood blocks fro111 bonding to the glass tabs. The clamp should be snugged down to Keep the blocks firmly in place, but not tightened hard. Allow theTayup to cure fully, then remove the

trim. Use your dremel to smooth out any rough edges. At this point your tabs should look exactly like Figure 3. Using a 3/8" drill bit, drill a hole as nearly in the center of the 5/8" diameter hole in the jigging block as possible. This is a clearance hole and not critical. Now using your 5/8" diameter spot face chuck the S4 dia. x 10" long steel tulot into your drill, insert it from the rear through the aft tab (3/8" dia. hole), then screw the 5/8" diameter spot face tool onto theeiid of the r,.t,, diameter􀁖. and locate the spot face in the 5/8" diameter hole in the plywood jig block on the fon,,ord tab, start the drill and carefully bore a 5/8" diameter hole through the 18 plies of UNO and the 18 plies of BID. (see figure 3). Drill slow to avoid heat. Now take the tool apart and repeat the procedure for the aft tab. When you have 5/8" diameter holes bored through both sets of gear attach tabs, you can carefully chisel the Bondo blobs from between the plywood jig blocks and the gear leg, and the jig blocks should then be easy to remove due to the grey tape release. 

Now, befor.e going any further, reinsert the 5/8" diameter ste􀁥l tubes through the glass tabs so that-the scribed mark lines up with the reference point (figureZ) You do still have the reference point Bondo'd on dont' you? With the marks aligned, scribe a mark on the steel tube, flush with the outside of eath glass tab. Then knock off the reference pointer and sand the strut and inside the tabs dull with 36 grit. Trowel a small amount of flox into the corner berween the glass tab and the gear strut (see figure 4). Make a generous radius in the flox and using the same methods, layup 18 plies of UNO from tab to tab, carefully stippling the UNO down into x 2½", the and corners lay the fore pads and aft onto the (figure glass 4 & 5 tabs ) per against the 2\ flox. Now, same as before, layup 18 plies of BID pad figure 4 & 5. Now use the same 2" x 2" blocks of ¼" plywood and with siran wrap (or grey tape) for a release clamp the tabs with moderate pressure until fully cured. After curing, trim the inside tabs layup down flush with the outside tabs (2"wide) and use your 5/8" dia spot face tool on the end of the 10" extension to bore the 5/8" hole all the way through both tabs. Drill about 10 #30 holes in each 5/8" diameter tube ( see figure 7) between the glass tabs. These holes will allow the 2 ply BID wrap (see figure 5) to mechanically bond to the steel tubes. Using wet flox, slide the tubes into the tabs and align the scribe marks previously checked. Get a scrap of urethane foam and carve it to fit under the steel tube, and a reasonable fit on the top of the gear leg (􀂄E SUTCH) Now layup 

2 plies of BID at 45° wraping around the 5/8" steel tubes, over the sma 11 carved piece of urethane foam, and down onto the gear leg. Make sure it also laps onto the inside face of each glass tab. Flox an AN960-1018 steel washer onto the outside faces of each glass tab (see figure 5) and layup 2 plies of BID over the washers and lapping onto the glass tabs. Cure then trim. Press the machined steel plugs (figure 6) into the ends of each steel tube. Your gear attachment fittings are now complete. 

INSTALLING THE AXLES I BRAKES AND BRAKE LINES. 

This step should take about 3 hours. Cut two squares of .063" 2024T3 aluminum plate, 2½" x 21" Be sure the flats on the ends of the gear leg are not toed out. A small amount of toe-in is desired (0° -½0). A hard sanding block can be used to adjust the toe-in. Refer to figure BA. Slip the Cleveland brake torque plate on the axle as shown -it must fit flush on the axle flange. Slip the brake caliper on the torque plate then, using this assembly as a pattern, use a coping saw and file to carve the leading edge of the gear strut to fit (with 1/16" clearance) as shown in figure 8. Also, trim the .063 aluminum plates to avoid interference with the caliper. Note that the caliper will move 0.1" as the brakes wear -be sure to a 11 ow for this with clearance. Lay up 3 plies of BID on the inside and outside faces of the lower gear leg, where the axles mount. While this layup is still wet, clamp the square plates (inside) and the axles (outside) onto the gear legs.(RPt.'f) 

Now, using a 2 ft. steel carpenters square on each axle, (figure 10), measure the distance between the tips A and the bases, B, of each square. Now B minus A should equal between 0.211 and 0.45" (¼ to i degree toe-in) to get this dimension, adjust or reposition the cla111>s using the caliper, check positioning. Recheck the meaurements A and Band allow to cure. After cure, use your-long ¼" drill and using the holes already drilled in the axle flanges as a pattern, drill through the gear leg and the .063 aluminum squares, and bolt the axles to the gear leg. f'O\J􀀛 M).q-)2A BoL,-s,eic&. AJ<f!.l 

Now install the wheels, tiresltubes and brake calipers and plumb the brake lines. Cut two pieces of 3/16" O.D. x .025 wo.ll high-pressure Nylafl_ow nylon tubing about 72" long. Now install one end into the top of each brake caliper. Use a short (½" long) piece of brass tubing such as the telescoping tubing found in hobby stores, inserted into the end of the Nylaflow tubing so that the fitting makes a better clamp on the nylon line, allowing higher pressure (figure 11). The tube required is 1/8" dia. x a.a 15" wall x ½" long. You will need four of these, two on each brake caliper and two in each brake master cylinder. Route the brake line tubing up the trailing edge of each gear leg to the glass attach tabs, then coil them up and tape them together to keep them out of your way. You can position the brake lines along the trailing edge by using small pieces of grey tape about every 4" -611• Now trowel dyr micro onto the trailing edge to fair into the brake line between the grey tape strips. After this cures, remove the grey tape, carefully sand the dry micro to a pleasing contour, do not sand the brake line at all, trowel a little dry micro into the gaps left by the tape, and layup one ply of BIO at 45° so that it wraps around the trailing edge and brake line and laps onto the gear leg approx l". This layup extends from the glass attacl'ment tabs to approximately 6" up from the axle centerline. The brake line then curves·gently forward between the brake disc and the face of the gear leg to the 90° # 269-P Nylaflow fitting. To avoid heat damage the tubing must lay flat on the strut, away from the hot brake disc. 

Now, drill a #10 hole through the firewallS£ethe brake lines through these holes, taking care to route left wheel to left master cylinder! Hook up to master cylinders as described above for the brake calipers. Pot the nylon brake lines as they go through the firewall with RTV (Silicone 't-ubber). Flip your airplane right side up on its own feet.
