STEP 1 
CARVING THE FOAM PIECES 

#### TODO: BAD SECTION

STEP 2 
LOCATING THE SHOULDER HARNESS AN D CANOPY ATTACHMENT INSERTS AND GIASSI?«l THE INSIDE SURFACES FOR WET ASSEICBLY 

Disassemble the foam roll over box pieces, cut the three plywood inserts shown, and locate them.as shown flush with the inside foam surfaces. Lay up one ply BID over all the inside foam surfaces. Let this layup cure"toknife trim, trim the  P'oat\ pieces, mix we:t M\C."T"O and reassemblethe roll-over box on the fuselage with nails holding it in place. Use M1c.ro on all joining surfaces. Be sure to sand the cured glass surfaces of the seat back and fuselage sides before bonding. Clean off excess M1c.ro and cure. 

STEP 3
GIASSI?G THE OUTSIDE OF THE ROLir-OVER STRUCTURE 

Sand a radius on the roll over peak and round all corners for glassing. Contour the foam around the inserts as shown. Sand the seat back and fuselage sides dull where the roll over structure glass laps over cured glass surfaces. Lay up the local buildups over the in­serts. The t_2 plies locally provide the required bearing strength for the harness and canopy stop bolts. Lay up two plies BID over all of the outside surfaces. These plies should overlap the adjoining seat and fuselage skins one inch. Lay up Atil:> three 1"WOl"d6it1ofl.Cl\ additi9nal o\le,t T"HEc plies over S'-ouLD􀀏 the MMt􀀒􀀓 peak 1-,..o􀀂 

STEP 4 
CUTTING THE ACCESS HOLES 

The access holes shown, can be cut after step 3 has cured. They allow the roll­over structure to be used as a handy map 8 case. Sectional maps inserted in the side slot are easily reached by the  pilot • ..L1

STEP 5 
INSTALLING THE SHOULDER HARNESS ATTACHMENTS 

The seat belt/shoulder harness assembly made to fit your LoN􀁃- Ei! and complete with adjustments, is available from the distributors. Drill a 1/4" hole through the center of the inserts in the roll-over structure and attach the front seat shoulder harness using the hardware shown, Refer to chapter 11. Bolt the aft shoulder harness to the tabs provided on the center section spar (use􀁑NP AN4-,A bolt), 

STEP 6 -Installing the seat belt attachnents and external step.

Refer to the 2-view shown of the seat belt attachnents. These are installed in four places (each side of both cockpits). The plywood insert does not have to be carved accurately to fit. Just rougTTt out to approximate shape. install with sufficient wet flox to fill-voids. and i11111ediately layup the 7 plies-w-BID. After cure. hold the extrusion angles in place and drill through with 'l-1􀀗 bit. Use a counter bore or your drenmel to flush the screw heads and install the AN525 bolts and angleswetwith flox. Do not counter bore the left forward position. These bOTts are used to attach the fixed step to allow short and medium pilots to enter the cockpit with the nose gear extended. A retractable step is not worth the trouble, since the aerodynamic drag of this step. when rounded as shown. slows the· airplane by only 0.2 knots! 

Fabricate the 1.8 x 4.5 x 4.5 2024T3 aluminum step. Mount with the four fasteners shown (two go through the seat belt attach). You will now probably want to remove the AN4 bolts so you can remove the harness assembly to store it in a clean place, until after the cockpit has been painted.
