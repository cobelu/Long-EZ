CHAPTER 26
UPHOLSTERY 

All of the six items shown can be purchased tor. from a distribu-tor. The front head rest is bonded to the 
rollover structure with contact cement. 
The rear head rest snaps over the two canopy 
braces. It can be positioned in the center, 
or to each side, for those who like to sleep 
in corners, 
The n:er seat cushion is an adequate 
size for any person, however,Me􀀇lu􀀊/short 
people may want to add a pillow or cushion 
to sit higher to see better. The front seat 
cushion is the correct size for the average 
pilot (6' ,3" to 6• ,5"). The smaller than 
average pilot !!!1\tl add cushion thickness 
in order to position himself high enough . 
for adequate forward visibility ( see ewtJt􀀜 MAAJOM. for optimum pilot position). 

Short pilots (less than 5'11") may want to take advantage 
of some extra baggage room 
rather than fly sitting on 
several cushions. This can 
be done by fabricating two 
inserts to custom-fit the unused area. The two inserts can 
be used as custom-made map 
cases or briefcases. Some 
use these areas for a survival kit and/or ELT.
