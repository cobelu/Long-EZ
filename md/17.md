CHAPTER 17
PITCH TRIM AND ROLL TRIM 

STEP ONE- MOUNTING BLOCKS 
Fabricate the PTl and RT3 blocks from ¼" 5-ply birch plywood. (Full size patterns pg. 17-3.) 
Pitch- Locate PTl, Drenmel-away the skin to clear the 
AN3-bolts (section A-A). Install the bolts then bond 
PTl to the fuselage side with flox. Cover with 1 ply 
BID that laps ½" onto fuselage side. Cure. 
Roll- Notch the right console ¼"xl" to accept RT3 
(see view X-X pg. 17-3 and pg. A-8). Bond RT3 to console and fuselage side with flox. Cover with 1 ply BID, lapping ½" onto fuselage side and console. Cure. 
STEP TWO- PARTS 
Fabricate PTH, RTl, two RT2 and four PW, or purchase 
them p􀀂efa􀀃 from a distributor. Refer to the spring _spec1f1cat1on . Cut the steel 0.35x.05 spring stock 
to the unstretched lengths shown. 
STEP THREE- PITCH TRIM INSTALLATION 
NOTE: Pitch trim is not shown on A7 or AB drawings. 
Cut two 20" length of 7x7 1/16" dia. aircraft cable. 
Using two ANl00-3 and two 18-1-C, swage one end of 
each cable to PTH. Install PTH as shown using all 
the hardware shown in section A-A. Cut two 2" lengths 
of polyflow nylon conduit and flox to instrument panel holes. Thread the cable thru and swage the ends at 
the 5.6 and 6.2 dimensions with the PTH handle at the neutral trim position. 
Install ANl00-3 thimbles in the elevator bracket 
(PTB chap. 11). Sew the PTS springs on as shown with 
two loops of .041 stainless safety wire. Now, install 
the canard and hook up the springs. The elevator 
should sit at zero degrees with the handle at neutral trim. After left console installation,cut the required slot to allow full travel and mark the "takeoff" 
position. Leave a 1" hole in the console to allow adjustment of the lower bolt to change the friction. Adjust friction to just hold PTH at full aft trim with full forward stick. 􀂂'f'\-\"'f􀂆 slo"Li M􀂎v- loL -sL..ac.lt 
This rigging should give you a trim authority sufficient to fly hands-off at 60 knots at aft trim or hands-off 
at 170 knots at forward trim. If your trim is insufficient on either end of the range you can make a minor adjustment by shortening one of the PTS springs-up to 1½ inches shorter. If this in insufficient, your elevator contour 
is incorrect. Further trim authority adjustment must 
be done either by correcting elevator contour or by adding a fixed trim tab to the elevator. 

STEP FOUR- ROLL TRIM INSTALLATION 
Using two loops of .041 safety wire and an ANl00-3 thimble, sew the two RTS springs to the two RT2 brackets and the RTl trim handle. Bolt the two RT2 brackets to the CS105 torque· tube with two AN3-11A bolts (see view X-X and pg. A-8). Clear the console if required to allow full stick travel. 
Pull RTl down and bolt to RT3 using all the hardware shown (section B-B). Tighten the lower friction adjustment enough to just hold RTl at full right trim with full left roll stick control. ltT Ti\􀀡 a.41111111, T'􀀂 11\ b•o􀁚 -s􀁜􀁝'"9 ,s -;r.,.,"t su1kt􀁫 􀁬t..c􀁯 .. 
Roll trim authority is sufficient to handle nonnal asynmetrys (fuel/baggage, etc.) at all speeds, to 
allow "hands-off" cruising. If more trim is needed 
it is because of a crooked aileron or wing and must' 
be adjusted with a shim washer to change wing incidence. 
The cosmetic cover for the stick area must be slotted to allow full travel of the roll trim tab. Mark the slot "Lt--Roll Trim--Rt".
