# CHAPTER 6 

## FUSELAGE ASSEMBLY

![](../images/06/06_00.png)

**OVERVIEW** - In this chapter you will assemlble the fuselage sides, bulkheads, and bottom. First, you assemble the fuselage bulkheads, checking for a good square, straight fuselage. The fuselage bottom is contour­ed, glassed, and installed last. 

### STEP 1 - ASSEMBLING THE FUSELAGE SIDES AND BULKHEADS 

This step should take two to four hours for you and one buddy. Don't try to do the last part of it alone.

Sand the bulkheads and fuselage sides for bonding where they mate, or remove peel ply.

Trial fit the firewall to each fuse­lage side. Trim until it will sit flush against the lower foam face with all three longerons protruding through. Use a car­penters square to check that it is 90° to the top longerons and mark this posi­tion on the top longeron.

Trial fit the front seat bulkhead to each fuselage side. With it lined up on the marks drawn on the side and its top and bottom flush with the fuselage longer­ons, drill several small holes from the out­side into the bulkhead. You will later 
install nails in these holes to temporari­ly hold the bulkhead in the correct posi­tion on the fuselage side.

Now, trial fit the forward bulkhead (F22) to the front of each fuselage side. Carefully line up the two longerons in the correct position and drill holes through the bulkhead and into each longeron. Note that the inside skin of the fuselage lines up with the bulkhead edge.

You will later install nails in these holes to temporarily hold the bulkhead in posi­tion until the epoxy cures.

Now, trial fit the rear seat bulkhead in place on each fuselage side. It should be flush with the bottom and with the spar cutout and should sit flat against the wood piece without touching the metal landing gear brackets. Clecos or small wood screws are very handy to hold this bulk­head during cure. With the bulkhead cor­rectly located, drill 1/8" holes as shown.

Trial flt the instrument panel to each fuselage to check that the bottom edge is flush and the sides fit correctly. Nails/clecos are **not** required to position this bulkhead during assembly.

Do not be concerned if you have gaps up to 1/4" in any bulkhead fit. These can easily be filled with flox or micro during assembly. The primary strength of the side/bulkhead joints is in the glass tapes that are later laid into the corners.

Now, lay two blocks on your table approximately two to three feet long and two to four inches high. Level them with respect to each other as shown.

#### Left off here.

You will now set·the fuselage sides upside down on th• blocks and trial fit the bulkheads as a complete unit. Install them in the following orders front seat , instrument panel, F22, rear seat and fire­wall, Refer to the photos. Place some scrap lumber along the outsides of the fuselage and hold together with rubber bands to hold the sides flat against the front seat bulkhead ·or at any place where they will not stay in place. Now, use the carpenters level and square to check the squareness of the temporary jigged fuse­lage. Refer to the top view sketch and check the symmetry of the fuselage. It may be difficult to get everything exact­ly straight, but do your best to at least get the straight top longerons level and parallel, and to not get the firewall crooked. Now, disassemble everything, recheck all bond areas are sanded dull, mix up flox and apply it to all bulkheads,1flc.lul,,.s the firewall.

Reassemble 'the parts and again care:f'ully check the alignment. Glass tapes are ap­plied now (while the flox is still wet) in the corners of the instrument panel and the front seat bulkhead as shown. The clecos in the-rear seat are in the way so just wipe away excess flox,and 1ape 􀀉 cure. • The front F22 bulkhead 􀀊tapes only in the area shown (its other reinforce­ments are installed in chapter 13) • All glass tapes have a 45-degree fiber orien­tation. Recheck alignment and leave alone without moving anything for 12 hours.

Set the block back on the upside down fuselage (still on saw horses), Weight it in place and get downinside the fuse­lage and see how the contours look, When you're satisfied that they fit and look good, you' re ready to ccu\'t '" ue, Locate the foam block on the fuselage, then use weights to hold the flexible foam down on the curved fuselage as shown. Position a pair of long 2x4's on the foam as shown with scrap wood shims to keep them from rocking on the curved foam. Use Bondo dabs to temporarily hold the 2x4's and shims to the foam. Don't make huge blobs, but use plenty of small ones so that when the weights are remove􀁃 the boards hold the foam securely in its curved shape, The reason you're using the 2x4•s, is to hold the bottom block in its curved shape while you take it to the table for glassing. When the Bondo is hard, remove the weights and bottom foam block from the fuselage, Place the foam block, right side up, on your work table (see photo). Lay up two plies over the contoured foam face using '2 Pl•􀁌􀁍 Btt) @ .... St; 

The glass runs down the forward face. Run the fibers at 45°, trim the selvage, and overlap the joints OIH' inct\. Add a third ply in the back seat area, forward of where the seat cushion goes, This gives extra surface durability where the back seater stands when getting in and out, Two plies are sufficient in the curved areas where the cushions are placed. Scissor trim flush with the foam edges on the sides, Leave 2" excess cloth at the rear. Let this layup "tack" for two to four hours. This will allow the bottom to cure enough, so that the glass doesn't fall off wh􀀎n you turn it upside down onto the fuselage, Mix flox and spread a liberal bead along the mating surfaces of the longerons and bulkheads as 􀁠􀁡own in the photos. 

Now, turn the glassed bottom over and relocate it on the fuselage. Weight it into position again, being sure to get good contact along the sides and on the bulkheads, Clean off the excess flox inside and outside, Refer to the sketch showing what to do with the 1" of excess cloth on the back of the bottom block. This provides an excellent joint for bot­tom of the rear seat. Let the assembly cure fully, After a full cure, you can remove the boards, Bondo blobs, and weights. Flip the fuselage right side up, and tape the bulkheads and sides to the bottom just like you did the sides to the bulkheads earlier. Do not sit or stand in· your fuselage yet. It does not attain its stiff­ness and strength until the outside is glassed in the next chapter.
