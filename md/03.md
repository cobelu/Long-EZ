# CHAPTER 3

## EDUCATION

**DO NOT SKIP THIS SECTION.** Every hour you spend in this preparation section will save you five when you really start building your aircraft.

## GENERAL

In this section you won't build any part of your airplane. What you will do is learn how to build your airplane the right way. This construction technique is radically different from anything you've done before (including building boats, surfboards, airplanes, and Go-Karts), and you should assume there is only one correct way to do it. We've discovered lots and lots of wrong ways of doing things and have written the plans to keep you from repeating our mistakes. We insist that you do things our way. If you have a better idea, suggest it to us. We'll publish details in the "Canard Pusher."

This section will teach you all of the techniques required to build your airplane, show you what special tools you need and how to use them. The educational samples that you will build in this section are designed to give you experience and confidence in all of the techniques that you will use in the construction of your airplane. The steps in the construction of each sample are arranged in sequence (as are the steps in construction of the actual aircraft parts) and you should follow the sequence without skipping any steps. You will learn the basic glass layup technique used throughout the aircraft, special corner treatments, foam shaping/cutting, and joining methods. A summary of these techniques is provided on yellow paper for you to tack up on your shop wall.

## TOOLS

There are certain tools which are necessary to complete the aircraft. Three lists of tools are provided here. The first is the absolute bare minimum required, sacrificing efficiency; the second is a recommended list for the best compromise of cost and work efficiency; the third is a list for the "Cadillac" of shops where ease of construction is more important than money. The uncommon items are stocked by the Long-EZ distributors.
