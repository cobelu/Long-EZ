There are indications that the back injury noted on accidents (pg 3) may have been caused by the center speed brake diagonal bulkhead being forced through the seat back after failure of the landing gear and the airplane's belly impacted the ground.  Refer to the sketch and remove the portion of the plywood bulkhead (part #LB9) shown to allow it to collapse without piercing the seat bulkhead.  Double check that the speed brake arm (#LB20 & #LB2) does not go over center with speed brake down - recheck the 40 lb. closure force.
