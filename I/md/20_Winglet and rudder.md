# Chapter 20

## Winglet and rudder

**Overview**: This chapter involves building the large vertical fins, mounting them to the wingtips, building and mounting the lower vertical fins, fabricating the rudders and hooking up rudder controls.
The right wingtip is shown.
Reverse to a mirror image for the left winglet.
The upper fin has undercamber facing outboard.
The lower fin is cambered inboard.
In-flight, the upper fin lifts inward and the lower fin lifts outward.
This lift distribution works against the normal vortex rotation at the wingtip, increasing the effective aspect ratio.
The result is an increase in climb and range, as compared to a vertical fin not designed using the NASA Whitcomb-winglet technology.

### Step 1 - Cutting cores

Refer to the plan-form view {in Figure 20-2} and hot-wire configuration drawing.
The hot-wire templates are on pages A3, A11 and A14

1. A3 Winglet root and Winglet tip
2. A11 winglet trim template (bottom of page)
3. A14 Winglet bottom tip template (top of page)
{CP25 PC 13 MEO}

Refer to chapter 3 and 7 for details on hot-wiring cores.
The {A3} root (WL 18.4) template is used for the top and bottom fin.
Hot-wire the cores.
Then round the bottom pieces LE and shape it's tip as shown {in Figure 20-2}.
Do not round the top winglet.

![Plan view](../images/20/20_01.png) Figure 20-2: Plan view of winglet

### Step 2 - Glassing the skins

Note the top fin is undercambered on the outboard side, full span.
The bottom fin matches the top at WL 18.4 then transitions to a cambered­ **inward** airfoil section at its bottom.
The left-over blocks the cores were cut from are used to jig the cores flat.
Glue these to a flat table.
The cores are easily warped until both skins are installed.
Jig them for glassing by nailing at the root and tip and, if necessary, with small dabs of 5 minute.
Recheck that **root and tip** level lines are parallel (no twist).

Glass the outboard skin with the following schedule:
1st ply UND – orientation diagonally from the root TE to the LE.
2nd ply is also UND, and crosses, from root LE to tip TE.
3rd ply is on upper winglet ~~surface~~ only – it is BID at 45° extending from root, up 18". {CP34 PC104 MEO}
Peel-ply the entire BID surface.
Knife trim all around.

Refer to wing chapter {19 Figure 19-51} for similar LE and TE details to obtain the correct skin overlaps, then jig and skin the inboard side using the **same** layup schedule as outboard side.
Be **sure** the root and tip level lines are parallel.
Refer to the plan view.
Carve the 1" tall tip cap from urethane foam.
Round to a pleasing shape and skin with 1 ply BID.

![Layup](../images/20/20_02.png) Figure 20-3: Glass layup

![Leading edge overlap](../images/20/20_03.png) Figure 20-4: Glass overlap on leading edge

### Step 3 - Jigging upper winglet to wing

After cure, refer to page A11 for the winglet **trim template**. Cut this piece of paper out and wrap it around the **inboard** side of the upper winglet, lining it up with the LE (extend the level-line up the LE), and lining it carefully along the root edge.
Mark the trim line then saw the piece out (coping saw) sawing roughly perpendicular to the mark.
Discard the piece.

![Mounting Jig](../images/20/20_04.png) Figure 20-5: Jig winglet to wing

Now, layup your wing top-side up on the table, wedge it up so it doesn't rock around.
Weight it down with about 50 lb of sand bags.
Locate the winglet-positioning reference point (WPRP) and mark it clearly.
This is the inboard front corner of the aileron cutout.
BL 55.5 and FS 149.6 (see page 19-10).
Now, set the winglet on top of the wing top surface.
Have someone hold it and move it around until the A - B and C dimensions are achieved.
It's best to set a box along-side and tape a stick to it to hold the winglet upright while jigging.
The A dimension is (102.15") from WPTP to the LE mark on the winglet at the top surface of the wing.
The B dimension is (108.35") from WPRP to the root TE of the winglet.
The C dimension is (118.35") to the tip TE of the winglet.

A and B are critical and should be within 0.05".
C is not critical and can be ±1".
Once positioned, mark the wing top skin at the inboard edge of the winglet.
Remove winglet.
Cut the wing all the way through, being careful to not nick the rudder conduit.
Discard this piece.

![Jig winglet](../images/20/20_05.png) Figure 20-6: Brace winglet for attachment

Now, lining up the edges as shown {in Figure 20-7} and rechecking the ABC dimensions, jig the winglet to the wing.
This time hold it firmly in place with 2 or 3 3/4" diameter lumps of Bondo.
Support it sideways with a 3 foot length of 1 x 2 lumber with lumps of Bondo on each end.
Be sure this is not in the way of the A measurement.

![turnover](../images/20/20_06.png) Figure 20-7: Turn wing upside down

When the Bondo is hard, remove the box and recheck A - B and C.

### Step 4 - Inside layups

Study {Figure 20-21} Section C-C to see the inside layups.
Turn the wing over, extending the winglet off the side of the table, exposing the bare foam faces.

![stress](../images/20/20_07.png) Figure 20-8: High stress areas

Remove the foam locally, with a knife, as shown {in Figure 20-9}, by cutting out a triangular flox corner all around.
This is 2" deep in the "high stress areas" {shown in Figure 20-8}, and 1/2" deep around the other edges.
The "high stress area" extends from the rudder conduit to the leading edge, along the winglet wing touching edges.

![bonding](../images/20/20_08.png) Figure 20-9: Cut foam wedges for bonding

Do **not** remove the wings' shear web.
Sand the inside glass surfaces.
Carve block A to fit nicely as shown {in Figure 20-10}.

![Block A](../images/20/20_09.png) Figure 20-10: Block A

This extends from the wing TE to the winglet LE.
It is carved from 2 lb (green-urethane foam.
Laminate 2 pieces of 2" thick urethane.
Do **not** glue in block A yet.

Cut 8 strips of 45° BID, 4" wide by 12" long.
Now, layup the eight small inside tapes (layup #1).
Trowel in flox to fill the void.
Where the void is excessive, fill portions of it with foam wedges (see sketch).
The flox and foam wedges hold this layup firmly against the winglet skin and wing skin and spar cap.
Notch the 8 plies locally to fit around the shear web in the wing.

Allow this to partially cure to avoid an exotherm, then fill the flox corners and glass layup #2, the inside ribs.
These are 8 plies BID forward of the rudder conduit.
Extend two of the 8 plies aft to the winglet TE.
Position the rudder conduit at 13.2" from the winglet TE **along** the outside edge of the winglet.
Layup #2 joggles up over the conduit - trowel in dry micro to avoid air bubbles.
After sufficient cure to avoid exotherm, trowel in some wet micro and install block A.
Block A must fit well enough to avoid air voids.
Weight or nail block A in place for cure.

![Block A](../images/20/20_10.png) Figure 20-11: Install Foam Block A

### Step 5 - Outside layups

After cure, carve block A to a flat diagonal, **not** round, as shown {in Figure 20-12}.
Remove peel ply.

![Carve A](../images/20/20_11.png) Figure 20-12: Carve Block A to shape

Round the edges for layup and glass layup #3, the structural bottom - outboard layup.
This layup consists of 2 plies BID, extending 15" up the wing and 12" up the winglet in a tapering fashion as shown plus 7 plies UND.
Make the 2nd BID ply about 2" shorter to taper its edges.
Thread the BID around the rudder conduit.
Now, cut the following 7 UND plies, using care to orient fibers along the A dimension.

![Cut UND](../images/20/20_12.png) Figure 20-13: Sizes of UND Plys for Block A

Refer again to the sketch {in Figure 20-14}, layup the 7 plies of UND with fibers running around the corner as shown centered on the corner.
Keep fibers straight.
Peel-ply all edges to make a smooth transition.
CURE.

![Layup UND](../images/20/20_13.png) Figure 20-14: Outside UND Layup

After cure, turn wing over, knock out the Bondo lumps in the corner, remove peel ply and glass layup #4, the structural top - inboard layups.
This layup is identical in size, number of plies, and orientation as layup #3.
Lap the 2 BID plies 1" onto the outside of the winglet at the lower leading edge.
Peel-ply edges for a smooth transition.
Cure.

![Top Layup](../images/20/20_14.png) Figure 20-15: Top of Wing to Winglet layup

The top winglet is now structurally attached to the wing.
Remove the 3 foot 1 x 2 board.

Do not increase the number of plies – your winglet joint can withstand 90-degrees sideslip flight at 170 mph – considerably over normal requirements.

### Step 6 - Lower winglet attach

Trim the lower winglet as shown so its root – WL 18.4 fits up to match the upper winglet.
Fill the small voids shown with urethane foam and micro it in place.
Glass a 2" wide tape of BID at 45° to structurally attach the lower winglet at the outside and inside as shown (layup #5).

![Lower Winglet](../images/20/20_15.png) Figure 20-16: Attach lower winglet

Now you can install your desired wingtip light (see Figure 22-11 mid-page ~~Section III~~). {CP31 PC90 MEO}
The light must be installed at the position shown.
Do not add weight aft of that location.
Also do not cut into the structural area.
An optional fairing block can be installed as shown in ~~view~~ {Figure 20-21 Section} B-B to fair the wing tip into the the winglet surface.
Use any type foam covered with 2 plies BID.

### Step 7 - Rudder

Carefully layout the rudder dimensions shown {in figure 20-17}, on the outside and inside of the winglet.
Saw through the skin on both sides with a razorsaw, then cut through the foam, to remove the rudder.
The rudder is hinged on its outboard edge with a piano hinge.
The piano hinge is 7.5" long, extending from WL 18.4 up.
Study {Figure 20-21} section D-D and view B-B and {Figure 20-20} Section E-E.

![Rudder cutout](../images/20/20_16.png) Figure 20-17: Rudder cutout from winglet

Set the wing leading-edge-down.
Remove foam {from the winglet} as shown {in Figure 20-21 Section D-D}, 0.6" deep at the top and bottom and 1" deep at the front.
Glass 3 plies BID in this entire area plus an extra ply on the edge where the hinge will go (layup #6).
Knife trim.
After cure, trim the hinge area forward 0.2" x 7 1/2" to recess the hinge.
Drill and fasten the hinge to the wing with three AN525-10R8 screws, with K-1000-3 nutplates on the hinge.
Trim the hinge width as required to fit.

Grab the rudder and, in a similar fashion, remove foam all around the edges.
Remove 0.6" top and bottom and 0.8" on the forward face.
In addition, remove a tapered depression to reinforce the belcrank as shown.
The depression extends 2.4" deep from the hinge line, on the outboard side.
It is conical in shape and centered at WL 18.7.
Glass this area (layup #7) with 3 plies BID plus an extra ply at the hing and belcrank depression.

![Rudder Hinge](../images/20/20_17.png) Figure 20-18: Rudder Hinge Installation

![Rudder cutout](../images/20/20_18.png) Figure 20-19: Rudder cutout from winglet

When cured, install the hinge and belhorn using the 7 pop rivets and 2 each AN 525-10R8 screws, AN906-10L washers and MS 21042-3 nuts.
Install cable and swage fitting.
Max rudder travel is 30°.
However, the swage must **still** have at least 0.7" travel until it bottom on the conduit – {the} brake master cylinder **is** the rudder stop – any other stop will leave you without brakes!

Return spring – this returns the rudder to neutral on the ground.
In-flight, the airloads force the rudder to neutral unless the pilots steps on the rudder pedal.
Install the tube and hook shown {in Figure 20-21 View B-B}, near the top of the rudder along the inboard skin.
The 1" hole in the foam can be cut easily if you file some notches in the end of a tube and rotate it to saw the hole like a long "holesaw".

The edge, marked "A" {in Figure 20-21 view B-B}, is the rudder stop.
Long-EZs do not have, nor need in-flight rudder trim.
The edge at A can be trimmed to allow the rudder to move more inward or shimmed to move the stop outward, to provide ground-adjustable rudder trim.
Once trimmed for ball-centered flight, further adjustment should not be needed.
